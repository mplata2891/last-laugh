Why do you keep trying escape?

Why does everyone keep trying escape?

What does it accomplish?  Yes, you're trapped here, 
but is it so bad?  Here, you're safe.  Here, you can 
have fun, do whatever you want.  I can protect you.  

I can study you.  

Yes, you're not so interesting now, but I can fix you.

I can make you better.  You can make this place better.

All you need to do is stay.
