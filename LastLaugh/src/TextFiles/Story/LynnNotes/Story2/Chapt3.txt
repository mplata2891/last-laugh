(Orange)

Whoever this Architect is needs to install a washer.  

My clothes reek.  

What I wouldn't do for a shower... or to be anywhere else that 
wasn't so strange.

I need a clean shirt.  Turns out blood, and sweat doesn't 
smell too nice after a couple of days.  Or at least, I think 
it's been days. I don't know if time works the same way here. 

Do people even know I'm missing?  

Am I missing?
