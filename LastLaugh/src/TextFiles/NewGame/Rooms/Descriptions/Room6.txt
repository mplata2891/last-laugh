The sun.

You feel the sun.  You look up and see the sky, but 
you realize quickly you're not out of this place just yet.  

Walls surround you on all sides. they tower over you,
seeming to go upwards forever.  They're covered in 
murals of... cats.  

It's almost comical, but you notice quickly that their eyes 
all seem to be following you.  

Judging you.  

From the other side of the room you see something perched on 
top of what looks to be a ledge.  You move towards it.

No, not it, her.

The caretaker.
