I wonder if the theme of the rooms mean anything, or if they're 
just there to mess with my head.  The way the light 
reflects off the walls makes my head hurt.  

So far, the last room has to be my least favorite.  Of course,
when judging solely on design.  The red room is the worst period,
because something in there cut off my f*cking finger.  

Whoever designed this place... they really must've hated themselves,
or you know, people in general.  

But I have to admit the colors, the designs, they make me feel nostalgic.
Or maybe just sick.  

I wish.  I... don't know what I wish.  

Maybe to not be alone anymore.
