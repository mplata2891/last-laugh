(something with 4 elements)

This Room fills you with hope and a renewed energy. You finally feel some
respite in this damned maze. Oh, how you were hoping for this moment of reprieve.
Although, you don't know how long it will last for. You guess it won't be for
long.

This room isn't so much a room, rather than a long hallway. It's rather narrow
and quite long. You shout a "hello!", and it echoes. There are long glass tubes
fixed to the ceiling which are flooding the room in yellow light.

You slowly make your way across the room's wooden floor. As you advance, you're
able to see a cubic object the size of a small desk, about halfway from you and
the door at the end of the hallway. Sitting atop the cube is an (item).

You move past the cube. On either side of the door is (more items). You turn
around to face the cube again and you see the room's caretaker standing in front
of it, on this side of the room. He's small, with reddish brown hair and sharp
feral features.

It's a mongoose. . .
