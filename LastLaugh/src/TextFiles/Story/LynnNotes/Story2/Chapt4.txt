(Yellow)

I wonder if the colors mean anything, or if they're 
just there to mess with my head.  The way the light 
reflects off the walls makes my head hurt.  So far, 
the yellow room has to be my least favorite.  

Whoever designed this place really must've hated themselves,
or you know, people.  

But I have to admit the colors... they make me feel nostalgic.
I wish.  I... don't know what I wish.  

Maybe to not be alone anymore.
