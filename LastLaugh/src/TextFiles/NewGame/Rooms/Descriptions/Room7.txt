Cold.

It's so cold in here that you can barely stand it. You breath and it instantly
becomes frost in front of you. Everything in here is ice. The walls, the floor,
everything in here has frozen over. You move forward, just to make sure you
don't freeze where you're standing.

You're about to slip but you catch yourself and gather your bearings. You
attempt to move again, but this time much slower than before. As you move
forward you try to carefully navigate the razor sharp icicles hanging from the
ceiling.

Shivering as you glide across the floor, you take note of the hole in the center
of the room. A small pool of water sits there, undisturbed. Slightly past the
pool are a (item), and a (item), and an igloo. This room doesn't seem to have a
caretaker. You feel like there's something not quite right with this. Maybe there's
something you're missing.

With some trepidation, you make your way back towards the pool, and you hear, or
feel something call out to you from under the water. You bend down and lean in
close as the caretaker emerges.
