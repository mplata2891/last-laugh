The room is draped in a thick darkness. It lingers and clings to
your person. There is a chill in the air and a slight draft, but you
don't see any windows. It's not a large room, but despite its size,
it's difficult for you to see to far in front of you. You struggle to
make your way through the gloom.

Step by slow step,  you're footfalls echo and reverberate. The sound
assaults you from all directions, and a wave of nausea comes over you.
Your head spins, but you hold fast until it washes over and past you.
You stumble and feel as if you're about to fall, but to your surprise
you're leaned up against one of the walls.

You run your hands against the dark stone slabs and steady yourself
You open your eye's and you're able to make out a door. You also see
some items strewn about, and not too far from you, shadowed in the
corner of the room, a figure. . .
