My favorite color is orange.  

I used to sit out on the balcony and watch the sunset with my
mother.  She'd hold me close, and we'd wait for the moon to rise. 
She'd make hot choclate.  I'd pretend to be a dragon and blow steam
into the air.  

I would look down at the city.  At the lights.  At the roads.
At the people.  I watched them: the children, the teenagers,
the travelers on their bikes.  It would all be so disorderly.

They'd look so much like ants.

I would pretend to hold them between my fingers, and pop
their little heads off.  

Then one day I asked myself.

Why not do it for real?
