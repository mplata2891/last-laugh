I used to have a pet.  

A cat.  

In a way he was my first real life lesson.  

I was helping my mother unpack the groceries and I
had left the front door open.  He had slipped out and
I didn't realize it until about an hour.  I had pulled
on my winter boots, and gone out looking for him.  

I found him.

Pancaked in the road.  

Squished by a car.  

The second he'd been out of my sight, he'd been killed. Someone
had decided it was a waste of time to even consider stopping, and 
ran him over.

That day, I learned that the only way to ensure safety, my
safety is to control absolutely everything.  

You will not get out of here.
