A black dog. His fur is long and thick, and slightly disheveled.
He studies you, his pointed ears hearing something you can't hear.
His yellow eyes follow you as he sits motionless awaiting your
approach. His muzzle is slightly open, his canines exposed; he
seems dangerous, but you're drawn to him. You're cautious as
you carefully make your way towards him.
