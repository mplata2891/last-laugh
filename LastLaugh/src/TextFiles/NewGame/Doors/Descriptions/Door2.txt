The door is covered in stars.  

You reach out to touch it and it's ice cold.
The stars almost seem to flicker, so reach out 
again and tap the door.

The stars flash, something moves.  

Ok, maybe you shouldn't keep doing that.  

You pull back, and let out a long sigh.    

Why does everything in this place have to be so
weird?
