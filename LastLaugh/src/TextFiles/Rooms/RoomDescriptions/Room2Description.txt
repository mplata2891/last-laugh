Red.

The room glows, and pulses the color of blood. You begin
to sweat, and you feel suffocated in here. You feel a strange sensation
come over you, a feeling of anger, and you direct it at yourself.
But why? And where is the red light coming from?

You notice the room has six sides. The walls are bare and opposite
of you is massive iron door. In the center of the room is a black
pentagram with candles lit at each of its points. In the center of the
pentagram there is small red bird, that sits on top of a podium.

Between you and the pentagram are two items, and between the pentagram
and the door are another two items. . .
