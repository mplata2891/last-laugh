A mantis. Impossibly large, almost half your size, Anger exudes strength
and power. His deadly spiked legs, hang in front of him relaxed, but
readied to strike at any moment. The sight of them offer a promise of pain
and suffering. His eyes see everything and in every direction. His insectoid
body; green, lithe, and athletic, seems unnatural to you. It makes you feel
uncomfortable and unwelcomed.
