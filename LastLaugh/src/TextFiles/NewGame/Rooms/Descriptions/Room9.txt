Blinding.

This room is so different from the rest, not just in appearance
but in feel.

Being in here feels oppressive, but that feeling is contradicted
by the stark white walls, and the sunlight pouring in from the
room's small windows.

You realize, you're in some type of a barn, but there aren't any
animals. There's plenty of hay, wooden buckets, and common
farm equipment.

You walk deeper into the room and realize it's a stable. The room
is shaped like an 'L', and you turn following it to wherever it
may lead you.

You slow as you hear a shifting of hay. You come upon the room's
caretaker, a beautiful white stallion.
