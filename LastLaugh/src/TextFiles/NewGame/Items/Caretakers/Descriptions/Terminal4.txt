Slender in form with sharp angled features. Greed is a mongoose
with copper colored fur. She stands guarded against all. Her long
tail swooped forward, she shields herself from all that wishes her
harm. Her tiny black claws are a warning and a promise to those
who dare test her mettle. She is suspicious of you. Her beady eyes
hold nothing but distrust. Her gaze is one of defiance and resolve.
