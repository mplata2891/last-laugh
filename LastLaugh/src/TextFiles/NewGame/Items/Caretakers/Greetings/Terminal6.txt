<Her voice is proud and sinful>

"Hello, hello young mortal. Congratulations, you've come
far. My name is Heresy, and it's my privilege to oversee
this room."

"I know you seek to further your quest, but I can't abide
by that. Rest assured that your hopes of leaving this
place end here. My compatriots obviously underestimated
you, but I won't be making that mistake."

"However, I don't judge them too harshly for their failure.
They aren't as smart or clever as I am. What would you
expect from inferior beings?"

"Shall we begin this challenge? Are you up to task?
Can you decipher my two riddles successfully?"

"Best wishes, traveler."
