Heresy looks down her nose at you.  Her fur is sleek, and her amber
eyes stay locked on you.  She makes no effort to move from her perch
and you find yourself walking towards her.  

She meows, and you listen in a trance.  She still makes no effort to 
apporach you, but you reach for her.  She purrs and rubs her head 
against your hand.

You can almost hear a voice.  A voice that promises you comfort, a
way of life, a place to stay, a home.  

She is welcoming now, and warm.  The voice, however let's you know
that she will always be above you.

Now that your here, and hers she will never let you go.
