"Gluttony is who I am, and you've wandered into my
domain."

"The only way to get through is to go through me first.
Most don't get past, and they're left all aghast. As they
fail I prevail and I keep what this maze doesn't take.
What I keep is the flesh, as the maze takes the rest.
But to me that's what best, so tell me young fool, are
you ready for my test?"

"Answer correctly and save your sins, but one wrong
move and I'll flay your skin."

"Just how bad do you want my key?"

"Good fortunes, traveler."
