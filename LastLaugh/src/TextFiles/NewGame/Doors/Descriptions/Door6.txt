It's a huge double door made of some type of metal.  
It's gold, and covered with intricate designs.  
They flow and swirl down the door, etched into the
metal with care.  

They almost seem to glow.  

You reach out, you hesitate to even touch the door.
Something about it... your fingertips graze it, it's
warm.  

The handle is oddly shaped.  It almost looks like
a treble clef, but the top had a slight edge.  

The door is beautiful, but too extravagant.
