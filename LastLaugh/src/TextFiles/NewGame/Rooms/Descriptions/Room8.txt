You step into a stunning landscape.

The floor is covered with tall grass. It's as if you're outside, but you know
that can't be right. But you can't see the walls or the ceiling. . .

All around you are tiny butterflies, immersing you in their glowing purple light.
Are you finally free from this maze?

You make your way through the butterflies and the tall grass, running your hands
on the grass' tall tips. The tickling sensation makes you smile. You slow your
advance as you come upon a large oak tree. Resting on it's bark is the largest
butterfly you've ever seen.
