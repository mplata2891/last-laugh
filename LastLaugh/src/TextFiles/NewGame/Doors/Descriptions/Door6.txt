It's a huge double door made of some type of metal.  
It's gold, and covered with intricate designs.  
They flow and swirl downwards, etched into the
metal with care.  

They almost seem to glow.  

You reach out, but you hesitate to even touch the door.
Something about it... your fingertips graze it, it's
warm.  

The handle is oddly shaped. It almost looks like
a treble clef, but the top has a slight edge.  

The door is beautiful, but you decide it looks far too 
extravagant.
