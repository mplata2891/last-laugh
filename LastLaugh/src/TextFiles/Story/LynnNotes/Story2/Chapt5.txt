The tools in the room can't be used to break through the walls.  
I've tried everything.

I've even tried to smash in those stupid animal statues-machines-
whatever they are, but they're made out of some tough stuff.  Something
about their eyes... I feel like they're watching me.  Like they're 
taunting me. 

Can the Architect use them to spy on me? 

Will anyone even ever get this?

I feel like I should be leaving behind clues, but I 
don't even know how I got this far.  I want to help
you, but I can't even help myself.  

My hand, the one without the pinky has been tingling
for the last hour.  

I feel like something big is about to happen.
