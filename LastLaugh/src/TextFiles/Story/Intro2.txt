That's right, but why is it so hard to remember	anything else?
My god! It's not just the past night that you can't remember!
It's easy enough to remember your childhood, but what about
your adult life? You try hard to remember, but the stupid headache
viciously comes back. It's like the memories of who you've been,
have been erased.

Sitting on the floor, you look around. You're definitely in a
room, but it's too dark to make anything out. Maybe by exploring
around the room you can find some kind of clue as to what's
happened to	you.
