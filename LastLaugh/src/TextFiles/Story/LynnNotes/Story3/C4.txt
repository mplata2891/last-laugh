-Wiggles keeps hissing at them
-Possibly contains cameras
-animals mean something perhaps?

Thoughts:
I'm trying to stay organized, but Wiggles is making me
antsy. He keeps yowling.  

He bit me the other day.  He hasn't done so since he was
a kitten.  I must retract my earlier statement I do believe
the unfamiliar environment is causing him anxiety.
