The future is not set in stone.  

In another universe I might've caught someone who didn't have
an IQ of a pebble.  

You solve my riddles, with the little clues left to you by...
other undesireables.

Do you even comprehend what this is?  Do you understand your 
purpose?  Do you know why you're here?

Do you really believe that it will be better outside?

Why do you want to leave?

Why do you want to leave me?

Why are you so stupid?

I am very disappointed in you.
