You sleep uneasily. Stirred by whispers of dark intentions
you toss and turn. Your dreams find you wrapped in
darkness and cloaked by mist. Figures pass as shadows.
Who they are seem familiar, yet so foreign at the same
time.

You try to make your way in a direction, any direction but
it all seems the same. It's an endless maze of uncertainty.
Panic sets in and grips you like a vice. How can you escape
this horrible place?

The sweats drips off you as your knees buckle and hit the
floor. Your breathing is ragged and shallow. The world
around you begins to spin out of control and soon you feel
the cool earth greet you with a thud.
