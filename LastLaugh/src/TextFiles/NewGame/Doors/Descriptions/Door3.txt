This door is set into a square depression in the  center of the
floor and is made of iron. The door depression is square, and
forms a set of steps that lead to the door, surrounding it on
all sides.

Each set of descending steps is carved with ornate symbols you
do not recognize. The door itself is decorated with a grid, and
in the center of each square is a fist sized iron sphere.

At the center of the door, a carved head of a tiger with its
mouth open and holding a ring. In its mount you also spy a
keyhole, where the tongue should be.
