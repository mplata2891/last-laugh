Bored out of your mind one night, you decided to go out on a stroll.
Feeling the need for fresh air, you continue to walk far into the forest.
The scent of cotton candy and popcorn hits your nose. Following the scent,
you stumble across an enormous red and white striped circus tent. You walk in.
Surrounded by amusing lights and joyous music, you begin to relax. In that
moment...HONK!! Hahahahaha!

Everything goes dark. . .

You awake on the ground. It's dark and your head is throbbing.
You try to remember the events of the past night, but you
can't. Everything is a blur, and the more you try to remember,
The more your head hurts. All you can remember clearly is your
name.
