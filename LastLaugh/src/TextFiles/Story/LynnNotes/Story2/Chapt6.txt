(Blue)

My finger grew back.  

I don't know how it happened.  I turned away for a second, and
I felt something inside me stretch.  I watched as it sprouted, and 
broke through my makeshift bandage.  

I'm not going to lie, I screamed. 

I've been without it for... days?  Weeks?  Months?  And it decides
now would be a good time to come back.  

I tested it, and it works.  

I can bend it.  I can feel the walls with my fingers.  I can
feel the pain when I bang my fist against the wall. 

I want to go home.  

I want this to just be a bad dream.
