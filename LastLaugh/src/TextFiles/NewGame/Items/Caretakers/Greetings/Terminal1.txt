"Greetings Doomed One, I am the caretaker of this room.
My name is Limbo."

"You're in a terrible mess, and the only way out is to
exit through that door. However, I have the key, but it
cannot be given voluntarily. You must earn it."

"If you answer my question correctly, it is yours. If
you answer incorrectly, then a fate much worse may await you.
Don't fret too much, not all hope is lost. There may be some
clues lying around that may aid you in this quandary."

"I should also let you know that this is but the first trial
and the easiest. Every room you enter to will have a caretaker
ready to challenge you. Each time will only get harder.
You're route to escaping these halls has just begun."

"Good luck, traveler."
