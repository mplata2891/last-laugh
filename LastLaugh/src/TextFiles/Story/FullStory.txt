* Prologue
------------
	You sleep uneasily. Stirred by whispers of dark intentions
	you toss and turn. Your dreams find you wrapped in
	darkness and cloaked by mist. Figures pass as shadows.
	Who they are seem familiar, yet so foreign at the same
	time.

	You try to make your way in a direction, any direction but
	it all seems the same. It's an endless maze of uncertainty.
	Panic sets in and grips you like a vice. How can you escape
	this horrible place?

	The sweats drips off you as your knees buckle and hit the
	floor. Your breathing is ragged and shallow. The world
	around you begins to spin out of control and soon you feel
	the cool earth greet you with a thud.

* Intro
------------
	^Part 1
		You awake on the ground. It's dark and your head is throbbing.
		You try to remember the events of the past night, but you
		can't. Everything is a blur, and the more you try to remember,
		The more your head hurts. All you can remember clearly is your
		name.

	^Part 2
		That's right, but why is it so hard to remember	anything else?
		My god! It's not just the past night that you can't remember!
		It's easy enough to remember your childhood, but what about
		your adult life? You try hard to remember, but the stupid headache
		viciously comes back. It's like the memories of who you've been,
		have been erased.

		Sitting on the floor, you look around. You're definitely in a
		room, but it's too dark to make anything out. Maybe by exploring
		around the room you can find some kind of clue as to what's
		happened to	you.
