The room is draped in a thick darkness. It lingers and clings to
your person. There is a chill in the air and a slight draft, but you
don't see any windows. It's not a large room, but despite its size,
it's difficult for you to see to far in front of you. Despite that, you
make your way through the gloom.

Step by slow step,  you're footfalls echo and reverberate. The sound
assaults you from all directions, and a wave of nausea comes over you.
Your head spins, but you hold fast until it washes over and past you.
You open your eye's and you're able to make out a door and some items
strewn about. . .
