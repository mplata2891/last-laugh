  The Note class represents in-game text files that the user finds
  while exploring the game. The actual Note objects are left by a
  mysterious character called the Architect.

  The Architect seems to know who our main protagonist is, and isn't shy
  about admitting that he is part of the reason our main protagonist
  is in this particular predicament.

  The notes left by the Architect are collected by the player, and are
  stored by the player in a Notebook object. The notes my provide clues
  to particular in-game puzzles, or may shed some light as to who our
  main protagonist really is.

  Once a note is collected by a player, the player may open their
  notebook at anytime to read the note.

  The Note class is a sublass of the Item class.
