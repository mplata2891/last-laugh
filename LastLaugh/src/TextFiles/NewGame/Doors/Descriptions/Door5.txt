The door is  nestled in the roots of one of 
the trees.  It's made of wood, and seems to
be... pulsing with light.  

The light almost calls to you.  It promises you
safety. 

You know not to trust it.

The door is only about three feet tall, you'll 
have to crouch in order to pass through it. 

You run your fingers over the wood, you realize
you can feel it.  The pulse.  The heartbeat.  

You find the keyhole on the right side of the 
door hidden in the ridges of the roots.
