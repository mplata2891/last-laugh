You feel sick.  

The smell of rot exudes from all around you. The room looks like a 
thick jungle.  From above vines hang, and your unable to see the 
ceiling.  It all looks so alive, but the air is cloying and humid.  
You try to breath through your mouth and you can taste it.

Death.

You take a steadying breath, sweat on your brow, and take a step forward.
The hairs on the back of your neck stand on end, you can feel something 
watching you.

You hear rustling to your right, and you turn to look.  Something moved.  
It circles you.  

From the corner of your eye you can see something flicker ahead of you.  
It rushes at you, and you flinch back bracing for impact. 

Only, it stops, and you are greeted with the sight of what could only be 
this rooms caretaker.
