The door is made of solid gold, and it shimmers
in the sun's fading light.

Carved into the Door is an image of an elephant, bejeweled,
sitting cross legged, and wearing a crown. The play of the
light on the surface makes the image come off the door.

In his palm flaring green is the symbol of the eternal knot.
It hypnotizes you into comming closer, and you realize it's
a keyhole
