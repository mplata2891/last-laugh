Day 1

Whoever this Architect is needs to install a washer and dryer.  

My clothes are absolutely rank.

What I wouldn't do for a shower... or to be literally anywhere 
else.


Day 3

I need a clean shirt.  Turns out blood, and sweat doesn't 
smell too nice after a couple of days.  Or at least, I think 
it's been days. I don't know if time works the same way here. 

Do people even know I'm missing?  

Am I even considered to be missing?

I think this is considered a kidnapping.


Day...

I think I've been here before.
