The figure is a sharp looking black dog. His fur is long and
thick, and slightly disheveled. He studies you, his pointed ears
seemingly hearing something you don't, or can't hear. His yellow
eyes pierce you with their stare as he sits motionless
awaiting for your approach. He seems dangerous, but you're drawn
to him. You're cautious as you slowly make your way to him,
fearful that he'll attack.
