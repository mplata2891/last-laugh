Lust is a tiny red bird. Her eyes are black pools. They reflect a deep
well of knowledge. She cocks her head from side to side, studying you
inquisitively from her perch. She spreads her wings and adjusts her
crimson feathers. Chirps drip out of her tiny beak like honey, at
irregular intervals. They seem to call to you, in a language you don't
know, but one that you can understand. She is so much more than she
seems.
