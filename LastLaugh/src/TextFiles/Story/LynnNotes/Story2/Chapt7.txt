Purple

I think purple is my favorite color.  I think I'm
a person.  I think this place is real.

I think, I think, I think.

My hand hurts.

My everything hurts.

I just want to go home.

I don't want to be here anymore.

I tried to bang on the walls, to break through them,
to make noise, to do... something.

All I know for certain is that the walls aren't hollow, 
I'm surrounded by something completely solid.

The only way out, is through.
