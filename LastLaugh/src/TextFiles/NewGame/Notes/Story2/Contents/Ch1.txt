I always end up in the weirdest places.

Or at least... I think I do.  I don't remember.

Well, I know that I have to get out of here.  I think,
I've figured out how to too.  You have to navigate through
a series of riddles, and lists.  

The animal statue things give you the riddle and key.  The 
puzzles give you clues.  If I figure out more maybe I'll
write it down, but god, I hope I'll be able to get out of here.
