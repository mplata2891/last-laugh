What thoughts go through your tiny mind as you stumble through
my rooms.  

Do you appreciate all the effort put into them?

Do you take in every detail?

It took me years to build this place.

I spent so very long... and yet, it's still not perfect.

It will be perfect.  

You will help me make it perfect.

I will keep building, keep bringing people to my maze.

You are not the first to set foot here, and you will not be the last.

Good luck to you,

A
