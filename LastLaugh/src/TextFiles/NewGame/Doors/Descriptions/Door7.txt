Angel with trumpet
Angel with bowl
name of merope
made of platinum

The cave you're in has not door, save for the one you entered
from. However, the igloo has a small door barring its entrance.

The small door is made of a solid piece of platinum, it sparkles
with frost and it's icy to the touch. On it's surface, there is
a detailed etching of two angels. 

The angels stand back to back. One angel holds a trumpet up to
the heavens, and is blowing it. The other angel holds a bowl,
and is tipping it towards earth.

Underneath the angels, the name 'Merope' appears surrounded by
seven tiny stars.

You look more closely and notice that the seventh star is a
keyhole.
