I think purple is my favorite color.  I think I'm
a person.  I think this place is real.

I think, I think, I think.

My hand hurts.

My everything hurts.

I just want to go home.

I don't want to be here anymore.

I need to get out of here, to break something, to make noise, to 
do... anything, but be here.

I know for certain these walls aren't hollow, I'm surrounded by 
something completely solid.

The only way out is through.
