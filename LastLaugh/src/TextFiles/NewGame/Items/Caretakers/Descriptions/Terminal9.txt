Hair that looks too good to simply be hair. 
If love and peace had a child, the color of the 
child's eyes would be his hair. Treachery, the
Horse. Treachery gazes direcly at you while chomping
gracefuly on some hay. His gaze never breaks no matter
how the chomp may chew. This gaze of his does not
un your ease. Not refering to Horse as a sir suddenly
feels improper.
