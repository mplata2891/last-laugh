There is a buzzing in the air, an audible noise attacks your senses.
This room isn't necessarily cold, but it's not hot either. Though, the
buzzing certainly isn't making you feel comfortable. You scan the room
and notice that it's an odd shape. This room only has three walls, each
wall is painted orange and so is the floor. On the center of each wall,
there is a fixture.

You peer closer and notice they are statues. On the wall to the right
of the Door from which you entered is a statue of a tiger. On the left
wall there is a statue of a tarantula, and on the far wall, opposite to
where you entered, is a statue of a butterfly.

However, what catches your attention the most, is the narrow door
set into the center of the floor. . .
