My favorite color is orange.  

I used to sit out on the balcony and watch the sunset with my
mother.  She'd hold me close, and we'd wait for the moon to rise. 
She'd make hot choclate, and we'd both blow steam into the air.  

I would look down at the city.  At the lights.  At the roads.
At the people.  I watched them the children, the teenagers,
the people on their bikes.  They'd all look so disorderly.

So much like ants.

I would pretend to hold them between my fingers, and then pop
their little heads off.  

Then one day I asked myself.

Why not do it for real?
