The door is of average size, and made of Aluminum.
You touch it, and it's ice cold. There are grooves
that criss-cross the door, forming a pattern of
interlocking triangles.

Towards the top of the door, there is a barred window.
You grip its bars and extend yourself upward to try
and peer out. You see a stark white landscape.
A forested country side, fresh with snowfall.

You lower yourself and question what you've just seen.

With your hand on the center of the door you also
notice a small symbol. It's a circle, in the center
of it is an ornate upside down cross with serpent
tails protruding from it.

You run your fingers over the emblem, and notice the
cross like symbol is a key hole.
