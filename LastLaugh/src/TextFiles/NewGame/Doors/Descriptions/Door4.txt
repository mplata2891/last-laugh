Clearly divided in two, this door extends from the floor
to the ceiling and is half as wide as the room.

Painted on the door's copper face are four horses, two
horses, on each side of the door, each facing the center
of the door. The horses depicted are a white horse, a
black horse, a red horse, and a pale horse.

At the very center of the door is a latch in the shape
of a lamb, and at it's center a keyhole in the shape of
an ornate letter 'A'.
