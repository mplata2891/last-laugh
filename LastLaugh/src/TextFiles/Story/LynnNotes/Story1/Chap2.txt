I always believed there was a certain type of serenity in 
the dark.  I used to find comfort in not being able to see what 
was in front of me.  

As the saying goes, out of sight out of mind.  

But then what if all a person knew was darkness?

What would you do if you only had the comfort of your mind.
If the only thing you could hear is your own heartbeat. 
If you were trapped in room after room... How would you cope?

Please help me find out.

Your services are greatly appreciated.
