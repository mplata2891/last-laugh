You must be so happy.

To be so close to the end.

But... are you really, is there truly an end to all this?

What will you do when all this is done.  Will you want to
come back?

Is it truly better outside?

What if I did all this just for you.

What if I did this so you could be happy?

So we could be happy?

What if I did this to protect you?

Once you leave I will get someone else.  Would you really 
want another to go through what you have?
