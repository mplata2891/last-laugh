Menacing and formidable, Gluttony invokes a primal fear that resides
deep inside of you. He's a tiger, a man eater, and on a scale that
you've never seen before. He's massive in both size and weight. He
stalks back and forth, watching you. His giant paws move him silently
across the room. His eyes glow green and flicker with untold intelligence.
His striped from studies you, and in a strange flash of insight, his gaze
tells you everything. In this room, you are his.
