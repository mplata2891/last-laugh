(Orange)

My favorite color is orange.  

I used to sit out on the balcony and watch the sunset with my
mother.  She'd hold me close, and we'd wait for the moon to rise.  
During this time I used to look down at the city.  At the lights.
At the people scurry around like ants through the streets.

I would pretend to squish them between my fingers.  

Then I asked myself.

Why not do it for real?
